# A Typescript RxJS playground

#### Running the project with NodeJS

1. Run `npx tsc src/<file.ts>` to compile into a file.js
2. Run `node src/<file.js>`

#### Another way is using Deno with `deno run path/to/file.ts` and it will run typesript files in a single command without compiling it to a separate js file

#### Install Deno

-   Install deno using the curl command found in the official website for Linux / Macos and for Windows use `choco install deno`
-   Brew install deno if you're on a mac `brew install deno`

#### Run

Using deno to run in watch mode:
`deno run --watch <file.ts>`
